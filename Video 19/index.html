    <p>The Siege of Chittorgarh in 1567-1568 had led to the loss of the fertile eastern belt of Mewar to the Mughals.
        However, the rest of the wooded and hilly kingdom in the Aravalli range was still under the control of Maharana
        Pratap. Mughal Emperor Akbar was intent on securing a stable route to Gujarat through Mewar; when Pratap Singh
        was crowned king (Maharana) in 1572, Akbar sent a number of envoys, including one by Raja Man Singh I of Amer,
        entreating him to become a vassal like many other rulers in Rajputana. When Pratap refused to personally submit
        to Akbar and several attempts to diplomatically settle the issue failed, war became inevitable.[17][18]

        The forces of Pratap Singh and Mughal and Rajput general Man Singh met on 18 June 1576 beyond a narrow mountain
        pass at Haldighati near Gogunda, modern day Rajsamand in Rajasthan. This came to be known as the Battle of
        Haldighati. Pratap Singh fielded a force of around 3000 cavalry and 400 Bhil archers. Man Singh commanded an
        army numbering around 10,000 men.[19][20][21] After a fierce battle lasting more than three hours, Pratap found
        himself wounded and the day lost. He managed to retreat to the hills and lived to fight another day.[22] The
        Mughals were victorious and inflicted significant casualties among the forces of Mewar but failed to capture
        Maharana Pratap.[19][20][21]

        Haldighati was a futile victory for the Mughals, as they were unable to kill or capture Pratap, or any of his
        close family members in Udaipur.[23] While the sources also claim that Pratap was able to make a successful
        escape, Man Singh managed to conquer Gogunda within a week after Haldighati then ended his campaign.
        Subsequently, Akbar himself led a sustained campaign against the Rana in September 1576, and soon, Gogunda,
        Udaipur, and Kumbhalgarh were all under Mughal control.[23]</p>
